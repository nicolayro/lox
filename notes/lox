Lox is high-level language is a language in the C-family. (Somewhat similar to javascript)
Some notes about the language
    - Dynamically typed (saves time implementing it)
    - Automatic memory management (garbage collector - nice challenge to implement)
    - One type of number (double precision floating point)
    - 'Nil' (name helps it differentiate from the languages wer are implemnting it in :))
    - Different datatypes are never equal (no implicit type conversion)
    - No bitwise, shift, modulo or ternary operators (maybe I can implement?)
    - Variables are defined with 'var'. Uninitialized variables default to 'nil'.
    - Functions are defined with 'fun'.
    - First class functions (Closures!)
    - Classes! And single inheritance.
