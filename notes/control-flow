Almost turing complete!
I'm surprised about how easy control flow is. I have a simple expression
interpreter before, and I always thought the control-flow part would be
the biggest difficulty jump from that. I would guess this is simple in part 
because of how much we leverage Java in this implementation though - I'm 
very much looking forward to implementign a compiled version of this.

I note that ambiguity of then 'if if else' scenario. I have to look more into
have other languages handle it.

I also failed to evaluate the fact that the 'and' and 'or' operators actually
are control flow constructs, even though I exploit that very fact all the time,
for example with null checks or conditional rendering in something like React.

I was very confused as to why visiLogicalExpr was returning the evaluated
expression instead of true and false, and sat there for quite some time trying
to figure it out. Eventually I checked in the book - we have dynamic typing!
Meaning:
    var cond = "hi" or 2;
Actually evaluates to... "hi".

'Desugaring'. Very nice. For loops are just converted to already existing
internals by the parser. Nice.
