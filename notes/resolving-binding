This chapter was slightly boring at first, but as the features came along
and the theory matured on me, this chapter really was great. It even helped
me detect a small bug I had in one of my examples! I'm also really interested
in adding more features to the Resolver, but I'll don't wantto complicate 
things too much before the C part is done.

I also note this note of his: Many isolated passes are easier to implement,
but traversing the syntax tree does come with a very real parsing cost.

Some ideas
    - Static type checking (maybe as another pass?)
    - 'Break' check (and implement break as well)
    - Unreachable code
    - Unused code
