Interesting concept that a functional essentially is a postfix operator
with the highest precidence.
It's nice that we support currying in this language, seeing as we support
first class functions.
Arity: expected number of arguments.
Native functions are functions implemented in the host language, Java or C in 
this case. A typical example is print, but we do not supply it here because
of the builtin keyword 'print'.
