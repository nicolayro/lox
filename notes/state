Now we are implementing state! Statements don't evaluate, instead
they produce side effects. Some examples are producing user visible output
or modifying state.

A program in Lox is defined as a number of statements and the special EOF
token.

Lox is dynamically scoped, meaning that variables are defined within it's scope.
The environment is stored in a chain - a block has access to it's environment and
the global environment. When referencing values, we check in that order.
